A portal for playing relaxing games and earning points to acquire NFT booster packs

Idea: 
- A portal with mini games, trying to focus on games from a non competitive perspective and more from a relaxation perspective.
- What if the portal has seasons throughout the year, every season players can earn points per day whilst playing games, and the prize is to buy NFT booster packs using points earned and also by paying BlockDAG tokens as well.
- The NFT Booster packs can be created by NFT Artists, and the NFT artists can get majority of the funds from the purchases and the admin for the portal can get a small cut as well, this will allow NFT Artists to gain visibility on through this portal.
- Each mini game played can earn certain amount of points each day
- And then NFT Artists can earn ongoing royalties as the NFT gets sold/purchased moving forward.
